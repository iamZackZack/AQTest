# 🧠 Abstract Quotient (AQ) Test

**A Web-based Psychometric Test to Measure Abstraction Capabilities in STEM Education**

---

## 🔍 Overview

The **Abstract Quotient (AQ)** Test is a research-driven cognitive puzzle experience designed to assess a user's ability to think abstractly — a skill critical for success in STEM fields. Inspired by traditional IQ testing but modernized through interactivity and game design, AQ delivers a unique, engaging web-based test aimed at identifying abstraction potential in learners.

## 🧩 Features

- **Dynamic Puzzle Types:** Includes grid selection, image ordering, spatial reasoning, categorization, and more — all randomized to minimize pattern exploitation.
- **Real-Time Scoring:** Responses are evaluated in real time and mapped onto a psychometric model to determine AQ scores.
- **Leaderboards with Privacy:** Users can opt into a public leaderboard, where pseudonyms are **AES-encrypted** and decrypted only for display.
- **Profanity Filtering:** Strong filtering system protects the test environment by rejecting inappropriate usernames.
- **Multilingual Interface:** Available in English and German.
- **Engaging Animations:** Built with Framer Motion for a seamless user experience.
- **Gamified Storyline:** Instructions are delivered through interactive panels that reinforce the game-like structure of the test.

## 🧠 Why Abstraction?

Abstraction is the ability to simplify complexity by identifying patterns and generalizing rules — a foundational skill in fields like computer science, mathematics, and engineering. This test aims to explore whether abstraction capability can be measured independently of traditional IQ constructs.
